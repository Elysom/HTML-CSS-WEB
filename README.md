# HTML-CSS-WEB
This is a coding proyect involving making a web page from scratch using html and css.
The goal of this proyect is learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS properties and how they work and interact with eachother.

This whole proyect was made entirely by hand. For the styles like color palets etc I may have used colors.co.
Hope you like it.
